# All-Things-Web
Playing around with the web and its ecosystem!

This repository is mainly just for adding random texts so that you can be more familiar with committing to others. Add whatever you like!
Questions that I would like to be answered are the following: 
  1. What are pull requests?
  2. How do you change the name of a repository after it already has a name?  ANSWERED
  3. How do you add more branches to a repository?
  4. Please define the following terms (make up the selection where '<>Code' is). 
 
I am just starting out with GitHub obviously, but also am new to the whole coding subject and would like to learn based on the project-based technique. I'm looking forward to working on GitHub with others in the near future!
